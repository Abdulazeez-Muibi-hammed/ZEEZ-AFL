# AFL TEST INTERVIEW
Hi there, welcome to my GitHub
This branch is dedicated to the submission of the AFL Software QA technical interview

The submission is done in three files: 
1. A first file (afl_test_qa) which contains the solution to all the ten tasks
2. A second file (afl_test_functions) which contains the functions of the tasks that require unit tests
3. A third file (afl_unit_test) which contains all the unit tests for file no. 2 above

##Directions to run the Unit tests
1. Download all three files into a directory on your laptop
2. Open your command prompt
3. "cd" into the directory you downloaded the files to
4. run the following command: "python -m unittest *name of the unit test file*". E.g. "python -m unittest afl_unit_test"
